In R we have a dataset already loaded called `iris`. Let's see how the top rows (the head) of this dataset looks like, by running `head(iris)`.

```{r}
print(head(iris))
```

This is a data frame, but we would rather work with the data in tibble format. So we load the `dplyr` package/library, which contains the `as_tibble` function (among other things) and convert the data frame to tibble.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
iris_tbl <- as_tibble(iris)
```
