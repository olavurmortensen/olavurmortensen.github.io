# Experience

`2017 - present` **The Genetic Biobank of the Faroe Islands** *Bioinformatician / Senior Engineer*

I was hired to work with FarGen, the Faroe Genome Project. My main responsibility was to pre-process and analyze the large amounts of DNA sequencing data coming out of the laboratory.

I have had the privilege and great challenge to design the FarGen Cluster. From the start I tailored the cluster specifically for bioinformatics, from bare metal to user interface. The cluster is based on a powerful compute component managed by Kubernetes, and a efficient and reliable storage component based on Ceph.

In 2018, I applied for research funding from the Research Council Faroe Islands, and was awarded a PhD scholarship. In October of 2021 I decided to discontinue my PhD studies. During this time I took 26 ECTS worth of PhD courses. I also taught a PhD course in statistics in R, where I created the whole course from scratch ([olavurmortensen.github.io/r-for-statistics](https://olavurmortensen.github.io/r-for-statistics/)). I practiced my duty to communicate science to both laymen and professionals, both abroad and at home.

In September 2021, I received the new title of Senior Engineer, which was deemed more fitting to my role at FarGen.
